      <description>For over a year now I&amp;rsquo;ve been working together with Andres on the Kubeapps project at VMware and have made various videos of new features that we&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never stepped back to give an overview and answer the more general question, &amp;ldquo;What is Kubeapps?&amp;rdquo; and show how those features work towards a single goal.
The goal of Kubeapps is to help users and operators install and manage applications on Kubernetes and the following features work together to achieve this goal:</description>

      <description>This is part two of a series detailing the steps required to run Kubeapps on a VMware TKG management cluster (on AWS) configured to allow users to deploy applications to multiple workload clusters, using the new multicluster support in Kubeapps. Though details will differ, a similar configuration works on other non-TKG multicluster setups as well.
The first post described setting up your VMware TKG management cluster with two OpenIDConnect-enabled workload clusters.</description>

      <description>Andres and I have been doing quite a bit of feature work in Kubeapps over the past months at VMware and one of the key features that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on personally is enabling Kubeapps users to deploy applications not only on the cluster on which Kubeapps is installed, but to multiple other clusters as well.
Enter VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TGK): an &amp;ldquo;Enterprise-ready Kubernetes runtime which streamlines operations across multi-cloud infrastructure&amp;rdquo;, so naturally I was keen to test out running Kubeapps on TKG and deploying applications to a set of TKG-managed clusters.</description>
