      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with the people at &lt;a href=&#34;https://gosource.com.au/&#34;&gt;GoSource&lt;/a&gt; around 3 days per week while also working towards my commercial pilot license (more on that journey separately). GoSource are involved in quite a number of interesting projects, but for the past 5 months I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/about/&#34;&gt;United Nations Transparency Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to make product claims easy to verify - claims such as whether the product was produced on land that is &lt;a href=&#34;https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/deforestation/regulation-deforestation-free-products_en&#34;&gt;deforestation-free&lt;/a&gt;, or whether a battery in your EV was sourced with components that meet &lt;a href=&#34;https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/batteries_en&#34;&gt;certain sustainability goals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
